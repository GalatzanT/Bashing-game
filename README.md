# Words Bashing Guessing Game
Written in Python, using the GUI framework Tkinter.

I made this application for our student association's stand at "Zilele Clujului" to present the concept of bashing or key-bashing to people.

It's a very simple project that switches the letters of the words with the next letter of the alphabet. Then the participants have to guess the initial word. If they do so, they will receive a prize.
